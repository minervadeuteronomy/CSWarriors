Palimpsest allows users to create Notes, which they can edit as a text document, and link them together in a canvas view. Once they have linked up the notes desired, they can click Generate, and create a PDF of all the notes together, with prebuild styles for Chapters, Acts and Scenes, Dialog, and Lessons.

Palimpsest's goal as a tool is to allow creatives and educators flexibility in creating finished drafts, keeping all of the text in one place, allowing quick editing without losing cut files or paragraphs.
